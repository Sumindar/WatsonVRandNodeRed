# Watson Visual Recognition and Node-Red

Simplify calorie counting using the power of IBM Watson Cognitive Services. IBM Watson Visual Recognition food model provides a built-in capability for recognising 2,000+ different foods globally, which is perfectly suited to replace the manual process of food logging with automatic food identification using image recognition.

In this lab, you will create a calorie counter web app using Node-RED, Watson Visual Recognition and Nutritionix API. This web app analyses food images using Watson Visual Recognition service and extract nutritional information of the food analysed using Nutritionix API (The largest verified database of nutritional information).
